Computer Science B.Sc. student at the Hebrew University (3rd year), with hands-on experience building projects in **C, C++, Java, Python, and SQL**.  
I enjoy working on **systems programming, backend logic, data & SQL, and computer vision**, and I like turning course assignments into real, well-structured projects.
